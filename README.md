## Project Objectives

Given the post data on each social media platform, the overall objectives are:

•	**Improved Brand Identity** – This involves the implementation of a machine learning model for post sentiment classification to detect the post's tone before posting on social media platforms.

•	**Content Categorization and Summarization** – This involves implementing a topic modeling approach in categorizing posts for quality engagements.

•	**Content Strategy** – This involves the implementation of a regression analysis model for determining the effect of content structure on engagements across each social media platform.

•	**Automation** - This involves the implementation of a machine learning model, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis model to increase competitive advantage and efficiency.
