This project finds insight from both Text and Quantitative to answer business problems.

## Project Objectives

Given the post data on each social media platform, the overall objectives are:

•	Improved Brand Identity – This involves the implementation of a machine learning model for post sentiment classification to detect the post's tone before posting on social media platforms.
•	Content Categorization and Summarization – This involves implementing a topic modeling approach in categorizing posts for quality engagements.
•	Content Strategy – This involves the implementation of a regression analysis model for determining the effect of content structure on engagements across each social media platform.
•	Automation - This involves the implementation of a machine learning model, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis model to increase competitive advantage and efficiency.
